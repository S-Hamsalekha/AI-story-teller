Krishna and Sudhama

In the ancient Gurukul of Sage Sandipani, two boys, Krishna and Sudama, forged a bond that transcended time and status. Krishna, the prince of Dwarka, was known for his divine charm and playful wit. Sudama, a humble Brahmin, was his closest friend, known for his poverty and unwavering devotion.

Years passed. Krishna became the king of Dwarka, a prosperous kingdom of gold and jewels. Sudama, meanwhile, remained in his small, thatched hut, struggling to feed his family. His wife, distraught by their poverty, urged him to visit his old friend, believing that Krishna would help.

Reluctantly, Sudama agreed. He couldn't go empty-handed, so his wife tied a small bundle of roasted rice (poha) in a worn-out cloth, a gift from a friend. With a heart full of doubt and a mind replaying memories of their shared childhood, Sudama embarked on his long journey to Dwarka.

Upon arriving at the palace gates, the guards, seeing his tattered clothes, scoffed at him. But when the news of his arrival reached Krishna, the king's face lit up with joy. He ran out, his royal robes and crown forgotten, to embrace his old friend. Krishna washed Sudama's feet, a gesture of profound respect, and seated him on a golden throne.

Krishna, with a playful smile, asked, "What have you brought for me, my friend?" Sudama, embarrassed by his simple gift, hid the small bundle behind his back. But Krishna, with his divine sight, knew what it was. He snatched the bundle and, with great delight, ate the roasted rice. He savored each grain, his love for Sudama making the humble offering taste sweeter than any royal feast.

After their heartfelt reunion, Sudama prepared to leave, his pride preventing him from asking for help. He returned home, his heart heavy with the thought that he had not received any gifts. But as he approached his village, he was stunned. His old hut was replaced by a magnificent palace, his family adorned in silks and jewels.

Tears of gratitude welled in his eyes. He realized that Krishna, in his divine generosity, had granted him wealth without ever being asked. The story of Krishna and Sudama became a timeless tale, a beautiful testament to the power of true friendship, unwavering faith, and the boundless compassion of the Divine.

Birth of sita

This is how Sita became the daughter of King Janaka: 
The farmers of Mithila invited their king to begin the 
sowing season. Janaka brought forth his golden plow and 
offered prayers to the gods. 
As he plowed, he noticed ten tiny fingers rising up from 
the soil. There, in a freshly plowed furrow, he found a tiny 
baby, a girl, reaching her arms towards him. 
“She is a gift from Bhudevi, the earth-goddess,” Janaka 
exclaimed, “and she has chosen me to be her father!” 
Janaka named her Sita, which is Sanskrit for “furrow,” and 
he adopted her as his daughter.

Rama marries sita

Vishvamitra brought Rama and Lakshmana to King 
Janaka’s court. “This is Prince Rama of Ayodhya,” 
Vishvamitra announced. “He wishes to try the bow.” 
Janaka ordered his servants to bring the bow, and the cart 
groaned beneath its weight. 
Effortlessly, Rama lifted the bow. 
Rama strung the bow. 
Then he looked up and saw Sita, who was smiling. 
Distracted, Rama bent the bow further, and it snapped 
with a CRACK as loud as a thunderclap. 
“Someone has strung the bow at last!” King Janaka 
shouted. “Prince Rama shall marry my Sita.” 
But many wondered at the omen of the broken bow.

Hanuman’s Great Leap

Long ago, Sita was taken away by the demon king Ravana to his golden city of Lanka, across the wide ocean. Rama and his friends, the Vanaras (monkey warriors), wanted to find her. But how could they cross the sea?
All the monkeys tried to guess how far they could jump, but no one was sure they could reach Lanka. Then the wise elder Jambavan spoke to Hanuman:
“Dear Hanuman, you are stronger than you think. You are the son of the Wind God. When you were little, you leapt up to grab the sun, thinking it was a fruit! You have the power to cross the ocean.”
Hearing this, Hanuman grew taller and taller until he was shining like a mountain of gold. With faith in Rama, he stood on the mountaintop, folded his hands, and said,
“I will find Mother Sita and bring news of her.”
Hanuman bent down, pushed off with all his might, and soared into the sky. The mountain shook, trees fell, and the sea waves rose high. Hanuman flew like an arrow over the sparkling blue waters.
On the way, he faced many tests—
A mountain rose to offer him rest, but he said, “I cannot stop until I finish my mission.”
A giant serpent tried to swallow him, but Hanuman cleverly made himself very small and escaped.
A demoness tried to grab his shadow, but Hanuman defeated her too.
At last, he reached Lanka and quietly became small again so he could slip into the city unseen. The great adventure to find Sita had begun!
Moral
Just like Hanuman, we all have hidden strength inside us. With courage, cleverness, and faith, we can do things that seem impossible.
